#   usage: fetch-clang22.sh     prints the prefix of the clang22 release components/clang22/version pins, for
#          this host, through shipyard's fetch_clang22.sh: the Linux archive on Linux, the cross pkg on a modern
#          Mac, the native pkg on 10.9 (or the installed product at that release). Its clang.cfg reaches the
#          pinned 10.9 SDK: on Linux setup-sdk points it there; a pkg unpacked into the cache gets the SDK
#          link its sibling sdk109 product would have given it.
